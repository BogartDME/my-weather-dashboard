## About the Project

  Hi, My name is # Edwin Pietrowski, thank you for your interest in my project!

  This is a web application that allows the user to search a city and presents to them the city's current weather and a five day forecast. It will include weather conditions, temperature, wind speed, and humidity. The application will save past searched cities for quick recall of information.
